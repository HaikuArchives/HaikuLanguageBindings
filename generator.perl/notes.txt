An SGML approach might be the best way to go
binding
	C++ class name
	binding class name
	properties
	methods
		parameters - in order, C++ parameters and whether they will be inputs or outputs in the binding
		retval
	events

Okay, we need to be able to generate regular stuff in the bundle file as well
Probably the best way to do this is to create a BundleGenerator that is also a class generator
